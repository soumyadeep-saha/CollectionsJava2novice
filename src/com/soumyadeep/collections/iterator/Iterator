All of the collection classes provides iterator() method to iterate through the collection. The iterator() method returns the Iterator object through which you can access the collection elements in an order. Enumeration also does the same purpose. The difference between Iterator and Enumerations is: Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the underlying collection during the iteration with well-defined semantics.
