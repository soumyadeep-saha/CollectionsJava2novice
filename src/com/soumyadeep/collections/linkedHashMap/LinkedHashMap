LinkedHashMap is a combination of Hash table and linked list implementation of the Map interface, with predictable iteration order.
It maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries.
The iteration order is normally the order in which keys were inserted into the map ie insertion order.
The insertion order is not affected if a key is re-inserted into the map.
