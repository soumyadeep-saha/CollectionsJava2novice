TreeSet is a NavigableSet implementation based on a TreeMap. The elements are ordered using their natural ordering, or by a Comparator provided at set creation time, depending on which constructor is used. This implementation provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the basic operations (add, remove and contains).
